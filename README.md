# DermSight
### Conflict-Aware Multimodal Pre-Clinical Triage Platform

DermSight is an intelligent pre-clinical triage system that bridges the gap between how patients describe symptoms and how clinicians make decisions.  
It combines medical images, symptom input, body location, and temporal history to generate explainable early triage insights.

Unlike traditional symptom checkers, DermSight verifies whether patient-reported symptoms align with visual evidence, detects inconsistencies, tracks progression, and produces structured telehealth-ready reports.

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

Patients often struggle to accurately describe visual symptoms.  
Doctors receive incomplete, inconsistent, or low-quality input before consultations.

This leads to:
- Missed early warning signs
- Unnecessary clinic visits
- Increased consultation time
- Healthcare system overload

DermSight solves this through structured multimodal triage with explainable decision intelligence.
